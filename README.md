## Editor demo
the editor is [publicly available to test online](https://textgamemaker.com/). I am also not the greatest UI/UX designer, so I focused on getting the features in and making them usable rather than making a flashy experience. If anyone has some suggestions, I'd gladly hear them out or check out some PRs.

## Viewer demo
I have created a [demo viewer webpage](https://textgamemaker.com/view/) so that you can see what it looks like to have the game running. The demo viewer currently uses a default test adventure that I made. Please be advised, I'm more of a programmer than I am a storywriter, I leave the storywriting to my wife.

## History
this is an old project that I've worked on quite a few years ago. I think about five. I decided to resurrect it and make it public so that it is available for others to play around with. My wife is really into textbased adventures, so I decided to make something that she could use that would be a little bit more advanced than most of the text based game makers out there. There are a few things that are incomplete here. However, for the most part it runs and is functional.
